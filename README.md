# resume

This repo contains the R Markdown code for a resume I created. That file is WendyPhillipsResume.Rmd. It uses the latex template file svm-latex-resume.tex.

Both the R Markdown code and the tex file originated from the template described here: http://svmiller.com/blog/2020/09/rmarkdown-template-non-academic-resume/   

I applied fairly significant edits not just to the contents but also to the format of the R Markdown code. I applied many fewer edits to the tex file. Indeed, it has many more options than needed for my final resume, and I may eventually slim it down to just the necessary bits.
